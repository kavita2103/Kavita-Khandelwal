### Project 1: [Analysis: Avocado(R)](https://www.kaggle.com/kavitakhandelwal1234/avocado-analysis-r)
##### Analyze data to gain insight into
1. How avocado price and Volume vary with time?
2. How price and sale vary with different type of avocado's?
3. How avocado's sales and prices vary with different cities?
4. Which type of avocado's companies need to stock more?

### Project 3: [ML: Classification Models(R):](https://www.kaggle.com/kavitakhandelwal1234/avocado-comparison-ofall-classification-models-r)
* Classification is a core technique in the fields of data science and machine learning that is used to predict the categories to which data should belong. 
* For this project, I build models to predict the types of avocado. Used Classification models are:
 1. Logistic Regression
 2. Decision Tree
 3. Random Forest
 4. KNN/ K-Nearest Neighbors
 5. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
 6. Neural Network
 7. Generalized Boosted Model (gbm)
 8. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
 9. LightGBM
 10. CatBoost
 11. Naive Bayes
* Using above models, I was able to get the best model to predict the type of avocado with highest accuracy 93.32% and Area Under the Curve(AUC) 98.25% for Generalized Boosted Model. 
* Or, If User wants to go with the highest Sensitivity 95.18%, they can choose XGBoost.

### Project 5: [ML: Regression Models(R): Project Overview](https://www.kaggle.com/kavitakhandelwal1234/avocado-comparison-of-all-regression-models-r#Author:-Kavita-Khandelwal)
* Regression analysis is a statistical technique that involves finding the relation between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
