### Project 1: [Analysis: Avocado(R)](https://www.kaggle.com/kavitakhandelwal1234/avocado-analysis-r)
##### Analyze data to gain insight into
1. How avocado price and Volume vary with time?
2. How price and sale vary with different type of avocado's?
3. How avocado's sales and prices vary with different cities?
4. Which type of avocado's companies need to stock more?

### Project 3: [ML: Classification Models(R):](https://www.kaggle.com/kavitakhandelwal1234/avocado-comparison-ofall-classification-models-r)
* Classification is a core technique in the fields of data science and machine learning that is used to predict the categories to which data should belong. 
* For this project, I implemented the following Classification Models to predict the types of avocado using the statistical programming language 'R':
 1. Logistic Regression
 2. Decision Tree
 3. Random Forest
 4. KNN/ K-Nearest Neighbors
 5. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
 6. Neural Network
 7. Generalized Boosted Model (gbm)
 8. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
 9. LightGBM
 10. CatBoost
 11. Naive Bayes
* Using above models, I was able to get the best model to predict the type of avocado with highest accuracy 93.32% and Area Under the Curve(AUC) 98.25% for Generalized Boosted Model. 
* Or, If User wants to go with the highest Sensitivity 95.18%, they can choose XGBoost.

### Project 5: [ML: Regression Models(R):](https://www.kaggle.com/kavitakhandelwal1234/avocado-comparison-of-all-regression-models-r#Author:-Kavita-Khandelwal)
* Regression analysis is a statistical technique that involves finding the relation between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. 
* In this project, I implemented the following Regression Models to know the relation between the avocado price and volume(total sale) using the statistical programming language 'R':
1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. KNN/ K-Nearest Neighbors
5. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
6. Support Vector Regression (SVR)
* We can choose the best model by lowest root mean squared value among all of these models. Here, I get best model for Conventional Avocado is XGBoost Model and for Organic Avocado is Linear Regression Model.

### Project 6: [Forecasting(R)](https://www.kaggle.com/kavitakhandelwal1234/avocado-price-forecasting-r)
* Time series forecasting is the method of exploring and analyzing time-series data recorded or collected over a set period of time. This technique is used to forecast values and make future predictions.
* In this project, I implemented the following time series forecasting techniques using the statistical programming language 'R': 
1. Average method 
2. Naïve method
3. Seasonal naïve method
4. Drift method
5. ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average)
* For this project, I Forecast organic and conventional avocado's prices for next 12 months.
